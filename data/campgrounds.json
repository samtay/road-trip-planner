Two separate mountain ranges are visible to the east and west. Ten campsites are spread out over the entirety of the two-mile loop trail, and are marked by brown wooden posts that emerge straight up from the ground. Fixed to these posts are small square signs with campsite numbers ranging from 1-10, arrows pointing in the direction of each site, and a small brown square showing two white silhouettes of gender-neutral hikers with walking sticks and backpacks. The sites themselves are located in the inner dune areas, which are the flat low points between dunes. The ground here is hard-packed, firmer, and often slightly darker than the soft white sand found in the dunes themselves. In some of the sites and along parts of the trail, you can find bushels of varying types of grasses, which tend to be around 1-2 feet tall and dark green and tan in color. There may also be other types of vegetation along the trail and in the campsites, including the soaptree yucca. Depending on the season, the yucca have two main components: their bayonet leaves, which are dark green, about an inch wide, and sharp enough at the tips to warrant their name; and the stem, which is a tall, woody feature that stands vertically from the base and is often over five feet tall. When a stem is present, many creamy white flowers rest on its tip. The flower petals harden after they bloom in late spring, and transform into firm capsules that house the yucca’s dark brown, round seeds. Each site is marked by a bright orange post that protrudes from the ground, with the site number on it.","campsites":{"electricalHookups":"0","group":"0","horse":"0","other":"0","rvOnly":"0","tentOnly":"10","totalSites":"10","walkBoatTo":"0"},"contacts":{"emailAddresses":[{"description":"","emailAddress":"whsa_interpretation@nps.gov"}],"phoneNumbers":[{"description":"","extension":"206","phoneNumber":"5754796124","type":"Voice"}]},"description":"Due to current public health conditions, backcountry camping is unavailable.

At the beginning of the Flamingo campground and looking west, there is a white registration office located in the median between the incoming and outgoing paved campground lanes. From here, the campground is separated into two loops with road access encircling the campsites of each. Following a right turn to the northwest after the registration office, you are taken to T-Loop which is available for RV and tent camping with multiple pull-through style campsites. Trash receptacles are in the center median as you enter this loop following the one-way road to the right. Many sites in this area have electricity and water. Two shower and restroom facilities are in the loop area. The first one has a water source and a sanitary pump-out station for RVs. Some sites have shade trees. A campground host is located at site number 16. If following the road straight to the west from the registration office, A-Loop will be entered which is a tent camping only area. The one-way loop will take you past turn outs for vehicles and campsites. Some sites have shade trees. Two facilities provide showers and restrooms, the first one has a water source and sanitary pump-out station. Most of the campsites in these two loops have picnic table and fire ring access. Additional sites can be found by following the outbound lane from the registration office. By taking an immediate right turn to the southeast, the ECO Tent area will be on the right between the road and Florida Bay connected by a series of slightly elevated walkways. These tan enclosed canvas-like structures are often available in a furnished condition with each having electricity and a fan. Some Eco Tents are wheelchair accessible. Restrooms and water are available at a facility close to the Eco Tents walkway access.

Pine Rocklands are characterized by tall slash pine trees, with pealing brown bark and high green needles. The ground between the spaced out pine trees is a low lying shrubby mixture of saw palmettos, dense grasses numerous wooded shrubs. Craggy, chalky white limestone characterizes the ground, and can make walking off path difficult. If there has been a fire recently, there can be charred remains of burnt trees and crunch ash on the pineland floor Follow the slowly winding Pinelands road to a forked split to either the campground or a day use area. A slight left will take you to the campground. A white building with a green metallic roof welcomes campers to the Long Pine Key Campground. Behind this entrance station is a small patch of grass containing several garbage receptables and tall information boards including a map of the campground and interpretive information about fire’s role in the habitat. A red payphone stands next to the information boards. The campground road follows a one-way counter clockwise loop, approximately a mile in length, that is in the shape of an oval. Slash pine trees are the dominant plant species, but a wide variety of small shrubs such as beauty berry and sumac add purple or red to the green foliage. As you follow the road around in a slow arc moving south west, the loop is bisected by alphabetized roads ascending from ‘A’ to ‘K’. Each lettered road has anywhere between 5-7 camping areas. Camping areas include a paved slab for vehicle parking, a mowed lawn area, a circular black metal fire ring with a grill attachment, and a 6 or 8 foot gray picnic table. On alternating lettered roads, the restrooms sit in white buildings with green roofs and have two separate entrances on either side. White cement shower buildings have tall green roofs which are covered by solar panels for water heating. Through the vegetation to the north, there is a large blue human made lake, which surrounds an island with dozens of tall slash pines sitting atop the rocky outcrop. At the loop halfway point lies a small parking area and a paved, lighted walking path leading to an amphitheater. The amphitheater hugs the lakeside shoreline and contains twelve rows of benched seating, bisected by a center aisle. A large white wooden backdrop faces the benches as well as a presentation podium for a speaker. The road begins to circle around the loop and now heads to the northeast. The lettered roads begin to move up from ‘K’ to ‘A’ and there are spaced out camp areas on either side. To the south the Pine Rockland habitat extends for over a mile, with the tall slash pines looming over the campground. Following the road, to its completion the entrance station is approached from the opposite side and you can exit the campground area back to the Long Pine Key Road.","campsites":{"electricalHookups":"0","group":"1","horse":"0","other":"0","rvOnly":"108","tentOnly":"108","totalSites":"108","walkBoatTo":"108"},"contacts":{"emailAddresses":[{"description":"","emailAddress":"ever_information@nps.gov"}],"phoneNumbers":[{"description":"","extension":"","phoneNumber":"3052427700","type":"Voice"},{"description":"","extension":"","phoneNumber":"3052427728","type":"Fax"}]},"description":"Open seasonally November-May, the campground is one of two front country camping options run by the “Flamingo Adventures'' concessioner.

Turn right after the brown metal directional sign announcing the campground. You have arrived at the entrance. Welcoming you is a brown wood sign with the words Lost Creek Campground carved into the panel and painted white. It hangs from a beam leveraged by five round, multi-sized posts that create the sign’s base. Beneath towering lodge pole pines and Shasta Red Firs are grassy meadows with 16 tent sites distributed in an inner and outer circle. An Information bulletin board and pay kiosk is straight ahead. The bulletin board contains information on how to select a site, pay, rules, regulations and any current concerns regarding the campground. From the kiosk, go left towards site #1 and continue as the road winds around to site #4. If your go right, you will by-pass sites 1 through 4, and turn right in front of site 5. Lost Creek runs behind sites 2 thru 5. Wildflowers highlight the area during summer and fall colors resume their brilliance as the weather cools. Between sites 4 and 5 is Greyback Road, the former East Rim Drive. There is a locked metal gate swung across the road to prohibit vehicle traffic. This road is now considered a trail for hikers, bicyclists, and pet walking. Across from sites 4 and 5 is a native stone and wood structure. This restroom is closed due to water rights legislation which does not give the National Park Service senior rights to use of the water in Lost Creek and its reservoir. Instead, there are portable toilets, several which are accessible, stationed alongside the building. Beyond the closed restroom, the road continues in a circular fashion with access to sites 6 to 16. The road and all campsite parking are covered with small crushed gravel-like rock. Tent areas are mostly dirt and natural debris with some crushed rock. All sites are generally level with room to park two vehicles. Each site has one picnic table; bases are white and formed from concrete; tops are made of heavy planks of wood. Most are in the sun with a possibility of shade at times throughout the day. Each site also has one bear-proof, metal food storage locker. The park is home to many animals, including black bears. All of your food, garbage, cooking equipment, storage containers (e.g. ice chests), and toiletries (soaps, toothpaste, etc.) must be kept in your vehicle or in the bear-resistant locker provided at your campsite. There are tree stumps and logs throughout the meadow and around campsites. Many dead trees stand along and beyond the creek. There are trash and recycling containers in several locations in the campground. The creek is closed to fishing to save and protect native bull trout. Since the campground is alongside Pinnacles Road it is not quiet during the day due to cars traveling to and from Pinnacles Overlook.

Travel throughout each loop is one-way in a clockwise direction. At the front of each site is a wooden post with the site number. The sites are dispersed through a forest of lodgepole pines, mountain hemlocks, Shasta red firs, and subalpine firs. Douglas squirrels, gray jays, and Steller’s jays are commonly seen and heard. Each site contains a brown wooden picnic table, a bear-resistant food locker, and a fire ring with a grill. A paved or gravel parking area is provided for cars or an RV. Trash and recycling receptacles are dispersed throughout each loop. The first left turn from the main campground road goes to A-loop with 15 sites including one accessible site, A10. A restroom with running water and flush toilets is near A13, with women on one end of the building and men on the other. A fresh-water spigot is across from the restroom. The second left turn from the main campground road goes to B-loop which has 16 sites including two accessible sites, B1 and B6. There are two restrooms (as previously described) behind sites B5 and B10, and two fresh-water spigots near the restrooms. A right turn at the intersection of loop B goes to the Mazama Village Store, gas pumps, and Annie Creek Restaurant and Gift Shop.

E-loop is the largest loop in the campground with 55 sites, which accommodate tent campers only. There are two restrooms near sites E20 and E47, and multiple fresh-water spigots throughout the loop. Between sites E19 and E21 is a short, gravel access road to the campground amphitheater for park rangers and emergency vehicles, and for visitors walking to or dropping-off. F Loop has 29 sites, and two are accessible, F17 and F21. There is a restroom across from sites F1 and F2, and a restroom with an accessible shower between sites F18 and F22. Multiple fresh-water spigots are located throughout the loop. The end of the main campground road circles through G-loop. This loop has 37 sites with a restroom at the beginning of the loop and multiple fresh-water spigots throughout the loop. From July through early September, rangers present evening programs in the amphitheater, located between D & E loops. There is no parking, including accessible parking, at the amphitheater. Visitors must walk to or be dropped off. Drop-off drivers may use the gravel access road between sites E19 and E21 but cannot park there without the ranger’s permission due to limited space. Unlit walking paths from D & E loop which lead to the front of the outdoor amphitheater are soft soil, not a packed surface. In the amphitheater, lights are on the ground next to the 22 rows of wooden bench seats in three sections from left to right, with wide aisles. Benches face a stage and large movie screen protected within a white structure. There is no designated space for wheelchairs. On the left-hand side of the seating area is a large rock campfire pit, used at the ranger’s discretion.

The campground is in a field of grass, nestled between two hills dotted with scrubby shrubs. At the southern edge of the campground is a creek that runs at the base of the canyon. A distant view of the ocean can be seen beyond the mouth of the canyon. At the lowest part of the campground, if you are facing up-canyon, the restroom building is on your right. A short cement sidewalk leads up toward this single-story wooden building with a gabled, or simple peaked, roof. The roof has two solar panels on the roof. One is a solar hot water panel—a grey metal box, about one foot high, with two pipes attached, one with a spigot. The other is a photovoltaic panel, only about 2 inches high. The building has reddish brown, horizontal, wood plank siding. A shallow porch, with railings, wraps around two sides of the building, covered by a roof overhand, supported by posts and beams. You can access the porch two ways. On the building’s left side is a handicapped accessible ramp. The front side of the building has stairs with railings and five risers. On the ground next to the stairs is a metal box with two thick brushes that face inward. On the front side, the porch has a bulletin board on the wall, flanked by doors for two unisex restrooms. On the side of the porch is a large deep sink, with an adjacent wide wooden counter with a backboard, that overhangs and slants down toward the sink. From the restroom location, you can see fifteen shelters—three-sided wooden structures with grey shingled roofs. Each structure is shaped like a hexagon that has been cut in half, open on the side that faces the ocean. Each wall surface of the exterior of these shelters has a solid sheet of tan-colored siding. The interior walls are unfinished open frame construction. Mounted to one interior side wall is a metal box, about one foot high by two feet wide by one foot deep. Metal pegs and hooks on the walls are used to hang clothing and gear. A translucent fiberglass panel at the top of the back wall provides some natural light. Each shelter site has a picnic table located in or near the shelter. Tents are pitched in or near the shelters as well. The shelter sites are about 40 feet apart from each other. At the edge of the campground, on the downhill side, is a water station. This is a two and a half foot tall wooden post, with a pipe running up it to a faucet on top. Surrounding it on the ground is a wooden frame filled with rocks. The post has a water faucet, a small metal box screwed into its side. A wooden plaque with a sign that reads, Please help protect our wildlife. Please do not rinse dishes, brush teeth, or use soap at the water faucets. Please wash dishes at the large sink next to bathroom. Thank you.","campsites":{"electricalHookups":"0","group":"0","horse":"0","other":"0","rvOnly":"0","tentOnly":"15","totalSites":"15","walkBoatTo":"15"},"contacts":{"emailAddresses":[{"description":"","emailAddress":"chis_information@nps.gov"}],"phoneNumbers":[{"description":"","extension":"","phoneNumber":"8056585730","type":"Voice"}]},"description":"Primitive camping is available (15 sites; $15 per night per site; reservations required).
